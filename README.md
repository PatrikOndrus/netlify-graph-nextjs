  Simplify & Unify Data Access With Netlify Graph (with Sean Grove)
</h1>
<h3 align="center">
  This app was built live on <em>Learn With Jason</em> and it was super fun and I’m sad you weren’t there.
</h3>
<p align="center">
  But don’t worry! You can still: 
  <a href="https://www.learnwithjason.dev/simplify-and-unify-data-access-with-netlify-graph"><strong>watch the video</strong></a> · 
  <a href="https://netlify-graph-nextjs.netlify.app"><strong>see the demo</strong></a> · 
  <a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/learnwithjason/netlify-graph-nextjs&utm_source=learnwithjason&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=devex"><strong>deploy this project</strong></a> · 
  <a href="https://jason.af/lwj/schedule"><strong>see upcoming episodes</strong></a>
</p>

&nbsp;

With the new Netlify Graph product, you can read, write, & even subscribe to data from third-party APIs securely — without having to manage auth tokens or complex data fetching logic. Sean Grove teaches us how!
